Gemooy
======

This is the reference distribution of Gemooy.

However, it only contains one implementation of Gemooy at the moment, and
it isn't even the reference implementation.

And it doesn't even contain documentation, either.

These shortcomings will soon be addressed.  Maybe.  For now, see
[the Gemooy article on the esowiki](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Gemooy)
for a description of the language.

The implementation of Gemooy contained herein is in Javascript, and uses
the HTML5 canvas element to display the playfield.
