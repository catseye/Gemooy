### What this is

This is the reference distribution of Gemooy, an esoteric programming
language designed by Chris Pressey on December 2, 2010.

It contains a document describing Gemooy which shall be considered,
in lieu of anything more rigorous, the specification of the language:
[doc/Gemooy.md](doc/Gemooy.md).

It contains an implementation of Gemooy in Javascript which shall be
considered, in lieu of anything more formal, the reference implementation:
[src/gemooy.js](src/gemooy.js).

There is also a [Gemooy article on the esowiki](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Gemooy)
which contains the description, some example programs, and a
Turing-completeness proof.
